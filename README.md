# PlaneSift---MTG-card-search

This project is a Magic The Gathering (MTG) Card sort, which allows users to input any amount 
of parameters into our UI and return a list of all cards that fit those specifications (listed below)
  - Name
  - Converted Mana Cost (CMC)
  - Color
  - Super Type
  - Type
  - Sub Type
  - Rarity
  - Card Text (keywords and abilities)
  - Power
  - Toughness

The cards are read in from an online data base, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickgendotti/mtg-all-cards
We implemented both quick and mergesort algorithms to minimize the time of our parameter searches.
